## THE HERO'S CRUCIBLE ##
[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/natedsaint/hero-crucible.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/natedsaint/hero-crucible)

Melt your hero down and pour them into the crucible! 

To begin, use ``npm install``. This will use the default hero-starter. To link to yours, use ``npm link /path/to/your/hero-starter``.

To run your hero through the crucible and see how well-forged they are, execute the crucible script ``node index.js`` or use the npm run command with ``npm run crucible``

Make sure to test your hero to make sure the helpers and hero file export correctly before using the crucible!
